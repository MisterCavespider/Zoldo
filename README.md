# Zoldo
A Legend of Zelda clone made for the Casio fx 9860 gii calculator, written in C89. The fx9860 has a crappy LCD display with a resolution of 128 by 64 pixels. Moreover, it has no colors, only black and white. This means the only reasonable way of displaying a game is by using 8x8 sprites, but it's still difficult to get the point across.

The program is more of an engine than a game.
The end result should also be able to read files from the (SD) storage. This way, someone can make their own game, and use the program to render/play their own games.

Because of this, I am also working on a (really) small project that can pack [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) maps into Zoldo (.zoldo) files.

## Purpose
I made this project for two reasons:
1. I wanted to learn C. I had no previous experience of C. The original code was filled with a crappy of Java-like methods and C-like code.
2. I wanted to create a simple game. The Legend of Zelda (the original) is a fairly easy game to recreate, as long as I ignore dialog/lore.
